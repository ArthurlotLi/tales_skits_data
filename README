Usage:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To generate a dataset, make sure to do the following:

1. Install FFmpeg. The pip installation won't set the cli tool, so you
   need to install from here:

   https://ffmpeg.org/

   Make sure to add the directory with ffmpeg.exe to the system PATH,
   then restart your command line/terminal session.

2. Install requirements by running:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. If you don't have it, install tesseract for your platform and place
   on the system PATH so that entering "tesseract" in the command line
   or terminal doesn't throw an error.

3. Gather data and place in a subfolder called "data" in the repo. 

4. Run dataset_generation.py. Output data will be placed in a folder
   titled "TalesSkits".
